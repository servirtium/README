# Videos on Servirtium and its markdown format

There is a video of WorldBank's climate API being virtualized for testing with Servirtium-java here (12 mins):

Another video captures a day that service was flaky (2.5 mins):

# Language Implementations in the Servirtium organization

1. Java - [Servirtium-Java](https://github.com/servirtium/servirtium-java) (in this org) - ready to use, but the Kotlin one below is better
2. Python - [Servirtium-Python](https://github.com/servirtium/servirtium-python) - alpha quality (help needed)
3. Ruby - [Servirtium-Ruby](https://github.com/servirtium/servirtium-ruby) - nearly complete
4. Go - People wishing to lead development sought.
5. C# - [servirtium-dotnet](https://github.com/servirtium/servirtium-dotnet) - ready to use
6. Node.JS - Watch this space

If you want to start one of these then read [starting a new implementation](starting-a-new-implementation.md)

# Language Implementations elsewhere

1. Kotlin - [HTTP4's Servirtium lib](https://www.http4k.org/guide/reference/servicevirtualisation/) (external) - ready to use. Impl uses Http4K, but works fine for usages that otherwise don't utilize Http4K.

We're also looking to existing *Service Virtualization* frameworks/libs to support (and help refine) the same Markdown format.
